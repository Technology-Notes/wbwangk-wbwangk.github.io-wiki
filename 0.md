In Fabric, scalability can be measured in terms of the
number of channels, number of organizations joining a channel
and the number of peers per organization. From a resource
consumption perspective, the endorsement policy complexity
controls the scalability of network. Even with a large number
of organizations or peers, if the endorsement policy requires
only a few organizations signature, then the performance
would be the unaffected. This is because, the transaction needs
to be simulated at a fewer node in the network to collect
endorsement. Scalability could also be defined in terms of
number of geographically distributed nodes and latency in
block dissemination among them. Number of ordering service
nodes and choice of consensus protocol used among them
would also affect scalability. Though these are out of scope of
this study, are important aspects of network scalability.
Node failures are common in a distributed system and
hence, it is important to study the fault tolerant capability of
Fabric. In our initial and early study, we observed that node
failures do not affect the performance (during non-overloaded
case) as client can collect endorsement from other available
nodes. With higher loads, node rejoining after a failure and
syncing up the ledger due to missing blocks was observed to
have large delays. This is because though the block processing
rate at the rejoined node was at the peak, other nodes continues
to add new blocks at the same peak processing rate.
