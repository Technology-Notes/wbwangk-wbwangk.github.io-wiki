The above attribute contains a Twitter identifier, ChrisLundkvist. Signing the attribute with the
uPort signing key creates a claim that the uPort identity controls the twitter account with the handle
ChrisLundkvist. The attribute also contains a proofUrl which links to a Twitter post stating that this
Twitter user also controls this particular uPort identity. Thus this attestation creates a two-way link
connecting the uPort identity with the Twitter profile.

DEVELOPER COMPONENTS

Developer Libraries

We make a javascript library, uport-connect, available to developers to allow them to easily
integrate support for uPort into their applications. This library allows the developer to integrate uport
login events and signing of transactions using a standard web3 provider. Future enhancements will
include ways to log in to traditional web services using your uPort as well as to sign documents and other
data.

The uport developer libraries can be found here:
