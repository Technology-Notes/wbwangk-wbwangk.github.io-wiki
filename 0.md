2 AAA by Cloud Provider

Cloud provider is the entity which offers cloud resources such as computing,

network, network storage, applications that can be rapidly provisioned with

minimal management effort and paid only for the resources consumed when

needed [55]. These resources form services which are categorized into three

models by the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) [55]:

software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure

as a service (IaaS). The cloud provider must have five key characteristics:

multi-tenancy or shared resources, massive scalability, elasticity, pay-as-yougo

and self-provisioning of resources [57, 55].

Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) is a framework

used by the cloud provider for controlling the access of cloud resources,

enforcing policies, auditing and measuring resource usage [74]. The cloud

provider must use this framework for effective resource, user, network and

security management. The AAA is based on client-server model [65] where

the cloud user interacts with client and server has the business logic necessary

for cloud resources, user, network and security management. Authentication

is a process of verifying the identity of the user and authorization is the

process of deciding whether a user has enough rights to use the requested

service. Accounting is the process of tracking the resource usage by the user

for billing, auditing, data analytics.

Figure 1: General AAA Architecture

Figure 1 shows the general AAA architecture with client-server model

where client is a web or mobile application and server host authentication,

authorization, accounting resources and services. The Figure 1 is divided

into two parts where the first part has a cloud user and the second part has

a cloud provider. The provider has the protected resource which requires

authentication and authorization from the user. The user interacts with the

provider with client application which sends the request to the server. The

server has authentication and authorization services. The authentication

service verifies the credential of the user. If verification is successful the

request is forwarded to the authorization service. Otherwise, an error is

returned and the user is redirected to the client application as shown in the

Figure 1. The authorization service determines the authority of the user.

If successful, the request is forwarded to the resource service that returns

the requested resource by the user. Otherwise, error is returned and user

is redirected to the client application. The accounting service intercepts

the request between client and server and does the metrics calculation and

audition as provisioned by the provider. The AAA are further described in

detail in the following subsections.

2.1 Authentication

Authentication is a mechanism by which a cloud provider identifies the

cloud user before granting access to the cloud resources [82, 30]. The cloud

provider enables the user to use the cloud services based on the credentials

provided during the registration [54]. The provider authentication can be

categorized into three categories: what-you-know (knowledge), what-youhave

(possession) and who-you-are (ownership) [82]. What-you-know means

something what the user knows about such as username and password, PIN

code and public keys. What-you-have is something what user possess such

as smart cards, identity card, e-tokens (identity information encrypted on

a flash card). Who-you-are means something that the user owns such as

biometric characteristics such as fingerprints and iris scan. Some of the most

used authentication methods are described in the next subsections.

2.1.1 Username and Password

Username and Password are the most used authentication method. A cloud

user first registers to the cloud provider with user data, such as username,

password, email, phone number, credit card details etc [30]. Once the

registration is complete, the user is able to access the cloud resources with

the username and password provided during registration. This method is

easy to implement for the cloud provider and is familiar to lots of users.

However, it is not very secure authentication method, since, the security of

this method depends on the length and characteristics of passwords. Even

if the password is complex, it can be stolen by guessing, brute force. For

example, around 21 million accounts were comprised by massive brute force

attack on Alibaba’s e-commerce site TaoBao [71]. Besides this, complex

passwords are difficult to remember, therefore users end up using the same

password for multiple cloud provider or use password manager which again

increases the chances of password attacks.

2.1.2 Public Key Infrastructure

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication is based on the cryptographic

private-public key generated by a cloud user where the private key remains

only with the cloud user while the public key is distributed to the cloud

provider [30]. The private key is used to prove the identity of the user.

The PKI is also used for the security protocols such as the Secure Socket

Layer (SSL/TLS) and Secure Electronics Transaction (SET) with an aim of

authentication and data confidentiality, data integrity and non-repudiation.

Compared to username and password authentication mechanism, this method

provides better security since private-public key is generated cryptographically

and cannot be easily cracked. However, this method is not easy for

most of the basic cloud users since it requires knowledge of generating the

keypair and distributing to the cloud provider. Apart from that, in many

deployments there are chances to steal the private key and the hackers are

even able to crack it.

2.1.3 Biometrics

Biometrics authentication is one of the most advanced authentication method

which uses biometric such as a measurable behavioral trait or physiological

characteristics for user’s authenticity [82]. The behavioral traits are signature

recognition, voice recognition, keystroke dynamics and gait analysis. The

physiological characteristics, for example, are fingerprints, iris and retina

scans, face, finger, hand recognition. These characteristics or traits are unique

in every individual and thus the authenticity can be proved only by the owner.

Moreover, it is highly secure compared to other authentication methods as

it is very difficult to steal or crack the user characteristics. Biometrics

authentication is easy to use, avoids memorizing a password. There is no

need of any token and reduces user identity fraud. However, it is expensive

to implement as it requires a specific set of hardware and software as well as

the accuracy of this technology is still an issue.

2.1.4 Multi-Factor

Multi-Factor authentication is an advanced method of authentication which

uses combination of what-you-know and what-you-have or what-you-know

and what-you-are to provide authenticity of the user [30]. For example, the

user might user ATM card which is PIN or fingerprint protected. Similarly,

the user might login into website with a password and pass-phrase from

linked hardware (mobile) device. This method is also called two-factor

authentication. It is user friendly but requires higher deployment cost.



2.2 Authorization

Authorization is process of determining whether a cloud user has authority

to access the requested content or issue certain commands [42]. It is tightly

coupled with the authentication as the user must be authenticated in order

to get authorized. Authorization is required because in a cloud environment,

same physical resource might be consumed by different cloud users who

have different access control rights. Thus, cloud environment must have

policy to allow access to resources which belong to the user. The most

popular authorization system is eXtensible Access Control Markup Language

(XACML) and the most popular authorization framework is OAuth 2. These

are described in next subsections respectively.

2.2.1 XACML

eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) is one of the main

standards adopted for authorization system. It defines a declarative fine

grained attribute-based access control policy language [42, 34]. XACML has

four main components: Policy Administration Point (PAP), Policy Decision

Point (PDP), Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and Policy Information Point

(PIP) [42, 68]. PAP creates and manages policies to common central repository

and PDP is responsible for storing and analyzing policy information

from user request. PEP is responsible for authorization decisions based

on policies stored in the common repository while PIP provides additional

attribute values such as action, resources. These components interact with

each other with XACML request-response protocols. The components are

deployed and managed by the cloud provider to their servers. Moreover,

XACML has three main elements: Rule, Policy and PolicySet [68]. Rule

is unit of the policy and PAP combines rules to form Policy and PolicySet

contains set of policies. Furthermore, PAP assigns certain role to the users on

registration when resource is requested. The role is checked against assigned

role from the repository by PDP. On success the user gets response with

attributes and is able to access resources otherwise the access to resource is

denied.

2.2.2 OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is authorization framework that allows a third-party application to

obtain limited access to a resource on behalf of resource owner and with owner

consent [43]. The access is requested by the client or third party-application

which can be a web service or a mobile application. For example, a web

service might use facebook login which basically allows the user (resource

owner) to use facebook credential to authenticate and authorize the user for

accessing the web service resources. This framework is successor of OAuth

1.0 and is used by companies like Facebook, Google and Microsoft [64].

OAuth 2.0 defines four roles: resource owner, resource server, client and

authorization server 51. Resource owner is an entity/person who grants

access to the a protected resource and resource server is a server which

hosts the protected resource. The client is an application which accesses

the resource on behalf of the user. The authorization server is the server

which issues the access token to the client after successful authentication of

the resource owner. This token acts as user identity and is valid for certain

interval of time, like 24 hours.

The authorization flow starts with trigger from resource owner who wants

to access the protected resources [51, 43]. The trigger is followed by client

(application) which asks authorization from the resource owner and returns

the authorization grant on success. On success, the authorization server

returns the access token and this access token is then sent to the resource

server which validates the token and on success returns the protected resource.

Thus, a resource owner (user) is able to access the protected resource without

providing credential to the client.

2.3 Accounting

Accounting is measurement of resources consumed by a cloud user during

certain interval of time [56, 59]. The resources measurement is amount of

computing, network or disk space consumed. Accounting is performed by

logging of session statistics and resource usage information and is used for

authorization controls, trend analysis, auditing and billing. Furthermore,

the common business model of accounting is pay-per-use basis where the

user periodically pays for the resource s/he has consumed. Pay-per-use basis

has resource accounting model which describes all the chargeable resources

of the provider and how billing charges are calculated over resource usage.

This accounting model is provider specific provided in their web-pages. This

accounting model can be used by the user to perform their weekly or monthly

or annual accounting estimates.

Accounting system is composed of three basic services: metering, accounting

and billing as shown in the Figure 2 [56]. The accounting system

intercepts the traffic between client and server as shown in the Figure 1. This

traffic is received by metering service which extract the relevant data required

for calculating resource usage. These relevant data are called metering data

which is forwarded to the accounting services as shown in the Figure 2. The

accounting service analyzes and computes the resource usage based on the

accounting model and generates accounting data. Finally, the accounting

data is used by billing service to generate billing data which is sent to the

user as receipt or invoice and the user pays this invoice using the credit card

information provided during their registration.

2.4 Potential Vulnerabilities

Although AAA framework has been used over a decade by cloud providers, it

has various major potential vulnerabilities such as distributed denial of service

(DDoS) attacks, brute force, man-in-the-middle (MITM), account hijacking

and data breach [35, 27, 42]. According to 2014 McAfee (a computer security

software company) report of Net Losses and the global cost of cybercrime,

there would be the global economic loss of between 375 to 575 billion

each year which is more than the national incomes of most countries and

governments [23].

2.4.1 Account Hijacking

Account Hijacking is an attack where a malicious user (attacker) is able

to retrieve a cloud user credential and use it on attacker’s favor [27, 42].

With this attack, an attacker can eavesdrop on the user transactions and

activity, modify their information, redirect to unauthorized sites and return

fabricated data. What makes this attack possible is that sometime the user

uses same credential into multiple cloud services which has weak password

and security. As a result, the attacker is able to use brute force or guess

user’s password and get access to their accounts. Likewise, an attacker can

even cause financial loss by modifying bank transactions and moving money

to attacker’s account. For example, Github was hit by massive password

guessing attack [37]. Similarly, according to Forbes, hackers hijacked phone

numbers and broke into email and bank accounts [73]. This attack can be

avoided mostly from the user end, by ensuring the user uses strong two-factor

authentication and cloud provider effectively detects unauthorized activities.

2.4.2 Distributed Denial of Service attack

Distributed Denial of Service is an attack where a group of compromised

malicious users flood a cloud provider with unnecessary request traffic. The

attack results in the denial of service for the legitimate user [35, 27]. The

unnecessary traffic might slow down or even crash and shut down the provider

services. The main intention of this attack is to disrupt the provider service

and prevent legitimate user from accessing the cloud services. So far, one of

the latest DDoS attack was on October 21, 2016 when Mirai botnet crippled

many of American sites such as Twitter, the Guardian, Netflix, Reddit,

CNN [84]. The cloud provider might use intrusion detection or prevention

system and increase the number of critical resources to prevent the attack.

However, it is almost impossible to avoid this attack since it is very difficult

for cloud services to differentiate between good and bad traffic.

2.4.3 Man-in-the-Middle attack

Man-in-the-Middle attack is an attack where a malicious user (attacker)

can intercept and modify the communication between two systems [24]. An

attacker listens to the traffic between user and cloud service and eventually

splits the original traffic into 2 new connections where one connection is

between user and attacker and another between the attacker and the service.

Thus, the attacker acts as a proxy and is able to read, insert and modify the

intercepted data. For example, a researcher from Chinese University of Hong

Kong has found flaws in OAuth 2.0 protocol which allow attackers to sign

into a billion mobile app accounts using MITM attack [86]. The possible

solution for this attack is to ensure the cloud provider encrypts all the data

over the network, user uses virtual private network and secure shell to access

their resources.

2.4.4 Data Breach

Data breach has been one of the primary cause of online cyber-theft, account

hijacking and fraud in cloud computing [35]. The primary reason for data

breach are the centralized servers of the cloud providers which creates a

honeypot for hackers where they are able to execute multiple cloud vulnerabilities

such as phishing, denial-of-service, backdoors, spoofing, clickjacking,

MITM [35, 27]. Once, these exploits are successful, hackers can gain full or

partial access to user data and end up exposing user data to Internet. Some

of the recent breaches are: one billion Yahoo! accounts were compromised in

August 2013 [77], LinkedIn reported 117 million accounts details were sold on

data sharing website in a possible security breach [66]and hackers launched

attack against Sony’s PlayStation Network using Amazon EC2 service and

stole user data [35].

2.4.5 Malicious Insiders

Malicious Insiders are threats which occur because of lack of transparency in

the cloud provider process and policy compliance [27]. A cloud provider might

monitor their employees or users without their consent and grant access to

their data to third party organization. This leads to corporate espionage and

unnecessary surveillance of users. This threat can occur, both from inside

and outside of the organization. According to the 2012 CyberSecurity Watch

Survey 53% of threats were caused from outside organizations, 24% from

inside organization and 17% was unknown or unreported. So far, one of the

most alarming recent malicious insider threat was when NSA was able to run

Prism program which could monitor theoretically any users who belonged

to Giant cloud provider like Apple, Google, AWS, Facebook, Twitter [41].

Similarly, United State Domain Name Service Provider was able to shut

down Wikileaks.org for leaking confidential data [60]. The possible solution

to this threat is to ensure maximum level of transparency in information

security practices, compliance, processing, determining and reporting any

security breaches to the user.

2.5 Drawbacks

The major drawbacks of the current AAA framework are user data ownership

and high cost to deploy and operate AAA systems [35, 27]. The main

reasons behind these drawbacks are the AAA’s client-server architecture

adopted by the cloud providers and service level agreement (SLA). SLA is an

agreement between the cloud provider and the user which defines the terms

and conditions for the provisioning and delivery of the services including

security measures [29, 58]. Also with SLA, the right to use user data is

granted to the cloud providers. Hence, with client-server architecture the

user data gets saved to the central servers and with SLA the cloud providers

have full access to these data which they are able to monitor, trace, leak and

control at their will as described in section 2.4.5. This results to the potential

user data vulnerabilities and fraud as discussed in above Subsection 2.4.

Thus, though the data belongs to the user, it is eventually controlled by the

providers which is one of crucial issues of data privacy and security [52].

Moreover, the SLA requires the provider to guarantee no downtime in

the cloud services [29]. So, in order to achieve this, the provider has to

maintain data centers which would ensure almost 100% uptime for the cloud

services. The maintenance and operation of these data centers is expensive

as it requires lots of hardware for computing, network, storage, firewall as

well as cooling system with operations to ensure 24/7 support of the system.

Furthermore, the cloud provider has to maintain multiple servers to provide

fault-tolerant, distributed and decentralized system so that there is no data

loss and the system can be recovered on hardware or software fault. Thus,

the current AAA system is expensive to deploy and operate.

3 Blockchain

Blockchain is append-only digital decentralized, distributed ledger. It has

network of computers which maintain and validate transactions via consensus

with cryptographic audit trails. It was first described by Satoshi Nakamoto

in 2008 [61]. Satoshi primarily designed Blockchain as a foundation for

cryptocurrency technology such as Bitcoin 4.1. The core idea of blockchain

is fast, cheap, secure, reliable, transparent and trustworthy movement of

assets between two parties, without any trusted third party such as bank,

credit card company, notary [80]. The digital assets could be money, notary

documents, properties, contracts. For example, movement of assets is needed

for taxes, paying salary, bills, showing possession of particular documents.

Blockchain is based on distributed ledger shared by all the participants in

the network and on consensus protocol by which the majority of participants

agree on a conclusion [80]. Each created transaction is verified and validated

by the majority of participants in the network. The transaction is chained

together on spending basis and added to ledger which can never be erased.

The ledger is not owned by a central authority or central servers. Rather it

is distributed to nodes (computers in the network) over the decentralized

network. So, all the nodes on the network have an exact same copy of the

ledger. It can be viewed, verified and validated by anyone in the network

at any given time. Moreover, the transaction can be even traced to the

genesis of transaction block. This essentially removes the dependency to a

centralized server and decreases the chances of fraud.

Blockchain can be either private or public. Public blockchain is unpermissioned,

allowing anybody to use it. An example is the bitcoin blockchain 4.1.

Private blockchain is permissioned and created for a closed group of people

working in a certain organization or supply chain. For example, a supply

chain company might use private blockchain for their transactions.

Blockchain users range from enthusiast to financial and commercial

enterprises. According to survey by World Economic Forum’s (WCF) Global

Agenda Council, currently $20 billion global gross domestic product (GDP)

has been held by Blockchain [45]. But, WCF suggests there is going to

be a significant increase in Blockchain growth. So far, blockchain has been

very popular in financial, commercial sectors and has gained rapid growth in

developing countries.

Financial sector companies such as Nasdaq, Axoni, Deloitte, Finetch, The

Linux Foundation, IBM are leveraging the secure, reliability, transparency

and the ability to remove the middle man for their advantages [36]. Nasdaq is

using blockchain to record private security transactions. Axoni is managing

the post trade for credit default swaps along with Depositary Trust and

Clearing Corporation. Deloitte is working with startups and customers

to develop Smart Identity for banking client. Linux Foundation has an

open source collaborative project called Hyperledger for business. IBM has

various open source projects and is building the foundation of standardized,

production grade digital ledger. Finetch startup backed by 40 global banks

is developing a standardized architecture for private ledgers that could

significantly cut the cost and time to settle transactions.

In the commercial sector, Everledger and Factom have been actively

working with blockchain [36]. Everledger is focused on identity and legitimacy

of objects with blockchain. It uses immutable history of transactions and

consensus process to provide trust of transactions to its customers. It provides

distributed ledger of diamond ownership, which assists in the prevention of

fraud in the supply chain. Simlary, Factom is working on securing data with

blockchain. It has been funded by U.S Department of Homeland to capture

the data from border devices. Moreover, it is working on numerous projects

in China to build smart cities. These cities are integrating blockchain with

electronic data, notary services, financial transactions to ensure the integrity

of data.

In developing countries, on one hand the blockchain can be used for

fast and reliable transfer of money from abroad [80]. On the other hand, it

can be used to develop trust transactions. Word bank and United Nation

(U.N) have initiated various projects for digital identity to be used for land

registration and finances for small and medium sized enterprise. Beside these,

numerous leading universities such as as MIT [78], Princeton [62], Berkley [4]

are researching and supporting blockchain. There is also W3 [5] blockchain

community which ensures the guidelines for message formats, public-private

blockchain, side chain and evaluates new technologies related to blockchain.

3.1 Terminology

This subsection describes about basic terminologies used in blockchain

technology. These terminologies are Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network, block,

blockchain, distributed blockchain and smart contracts.

3.1.1 Peer-to-Peer Network

Peer-to-peer (P2P) is distributed network architecture [75] where each participating

node (computer) share its hardware resource such as computing,

storage capacity, network links with each other. Moreover, these resources

are used to provide services like content and file sharing and are available to

all nodes directly without need of any central server. Besides this, at given

time, a node can be consumer as well producer of the resources. Furthermore,

it is also used for anonymising routing of network traffic, parallel computing,

distributed file storage, media sharing.

Blockchain uses P2P network architecture to ensure distributed, decentralized

networking with no single point of failure [62, Chapter 5]. It has two

types of peers in the network: member peers and validator peers. Member

peers consume the blockchain services while validator peers are special peers

which consume the blockchain services as well as validates and verifies the

new transactions in the blockchain at the cost of financial benefit. These

special peers are called miners. Each miner has exact same copy of the

transaction history across network and has specific responsibility to maintain

and propagate the new transaction block across the network. The first miner

to successfully validate the block and propagate the result across network

gets financial reward.

3.1.2 Block

A block is a single unit in the blockchain (described in subsection 3.1.3) [78]

which is building block of blockchain and is composed of transactions with

meta-data as shown in Figure 3. A miner (described in 3.1.1) collects the

valid data (transactions) of certain time interval to form a block and calculate

the cryptographic hash. However, this hash has to be specific format such as

the hash must have leading four zeros as shown in the Figure 3. In order to

get this specific type of hash, the miner has to randomly guess an arbitrary

number which outputs the hash with four leading zeros. This arbitrary

number is called number used once or number once (nonce) and the block

with nonce is called signed block else it is unsigned. Also, the process of

finding nonce is called mining.

Figure 3: Block

A sample block is shown in Figure 3 where a block has a block number,

nonce, data and hash. The block number #1 is the unique id of that block

and Nonce 72608 is random arbitrary number guessed to find the specific

format of the hash. Finally, the Data is the user digital data which is empty

in this case and the Hash is the digital fingerprint of the data.

3.1.3 Blockchain

Blockchain is a data structure with linked lists of hash pointers [85]. It is a

chain of blocks where each block has a hash pointer to the previous block.

This hash pointer allows to verify and validate the digest of previous data.

If any value in the chain is changed the digest of that block and the hash

pointer of following blocks will change. Thus, this creates tamper-evident

log which cannot be changed. Moreover, the hash pointer can be followed

till the very first block called the genesis block of blockchain.

Figure 4: Blockchain

A sample blockchain is shown in figure 4 where two blocks are chained

together to form a blockchain. Here, each block has a block number, nonce,

data, previous block hash and current block hash. Moreover, Block #1 is

the genesis block of the blockchain and the hash of previous hash pointer is

null (00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

00) integer while Block #2 as shown in figure 4 is the second block of the

blockchain which has the hash pointer of the previous block.

3.1.4 Distributed Blockchain

Distributed Blockchain is blockchain distributed over P2P blockchain nodes

where all the nodes have an exact copy of blockchain. Thus, if one entry in

blockchain is modified and re-mined, the resulting hash becomes different

compared to other nodes. As a result, this transaction will get invalidated

since other nodes will invalidate this copy. However, a miner could theoretically

modify one blockchain entry and re-mine all hashes entry over

distributed nodes if it has more computational power than other miners

combined.

3.1.5 Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self executing autonomous computer programs that get

executed based on condition defined by programmer [36]. These contracts

are capable of facilitating, enforcing and executing agreements between two

parties using blockchain. Unlike traditional contracts, where a third party

(bank, notary) is required, smart contracts enable independent business

between anonymous parties with cheaper fees. For example, one can pay

room rent automatically at the end of month without involving a bank in

between.

Smart contracts have various possible applications such as trading or

loaning of properties, stock or bond trading in distributed markets [36]. Moreover,

it can be also used for autonomous transparent digital voting system or

autonomous digital notary contract system. In this context, companies like

Ethereum, Codius are enabling smart contracts using blockchain to support

these applications.

3.2 Cryptography

This subsection describes about the basic cryptography technologies used in

the blockchain. They are cryptographic hash function, hash pointer, digital

signature and Merkle tree.

3.2.1 Cryptographic Hash Function

Cryptographic hash function is a mathematical function that takes any input

string (data) of any length and outputs fixed sized alphanumeric string [62,

Chapter 1]. The output string is called hash value or digest or digital

fingerprint or checksum. Moreover, the output is of fixed length and unique.

The function always produces the same hash from the same data despite the

number of times recalculated. The hash cannot be reversed to get the input

data and therefore, it can be used to check the integrity of data. Thus, it is

also known as one way hash function.

The hash function has three main properties, namely: collision free, hiding

and puzzle friendly [62, Chapter 1]. Collision free means it is extremely

unlikely to find two different messages that have the same hash. For example,

the hash of a string x and the hash of string y are always different, despite

how many times it is calculated. Hiding means it is infeasible to find x from

given hash of x and puzzle friendly means it is easy enough to calculate a

hash of given data.

Blockchain uses Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) such as SHA-2/SHA-256

which was developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2001 to

replace its predecessor SHA-1 to prevent collision attacks [38]. The latest

SHA-1 collision attack was reported by Google, which proved two different

documents can have same SHA-1 hash signature [76]. Furthermore, SHA-2

is widely used algorithm and so far no vulnerability has been reported. The

following is an example, of SHA-256: hash of hello is

2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824.

3.2.2 Hash Pointer

Hash pointer is a pointer to where data is stored along with digest of that

data [62, Chapter 1]. In other words, it is just a hash that is used to reference

another piece of known information which can be used to verify the data

digest (data has changed or not). The hash pointer can be used to build

data structures like blockchain (described in 3.1.3) which is a linked list of

hash pointers and Merkle tree (described in 3.2.4) which is a binary tree of

hash pointers.

3.2.3 Digital signature



Digital signature is another building element of the blockchain. It uses

public-key cryptography to provide the integrity, nonrepudation (obligation

of message sent and received by the parties) and authenticity of a message

and its source [81]. It has similar properties as a manual signature which can

be issued only by the issuer and which is verifiable by other users. A message

signed with a digital signature can be verified by other users, but the message

can be signed only by signature owner. Beside this, digital signatures

are created using public key cryptography. Public key cryptography or

asymmetric cryptography uses a key which is a combination of public and

private key. The private key is saved only by the owner while the public key

is distributed to the other users. The other users can encrypt the message

with the owner’s public key and the message can only be decrypted by the

owner with his/her private key.

Blockchain uses digital signature algorithm such as elliptic curve digital

signature algorithm (ECDSA) to generate digital signature [40]. It has three

steps to create, sign and verify message with digital signature [81]. The

secret key (sk) and public key (pk) are generated by generateKeys method

which takes key size as a parameter. The sk is kept only by the owner and

pk is distributed over blockchain nodes. The message is signed by using

the sk. The sign method takes sk and message as input and generates the

signature of the message. This signature can be verified with nodes using

verify method which take pk, message and signature as input. If it returns

true the message is verified otherwise it is invalidated. Thus, the public

key ensures the message has been created by the signature owner and with

message verification, user identity is verified. Hence, the public key is used

as user identity in the blockchain.

Using distributed blockchain, the users do not need to provide social

security number, phone number, email to any central server or authority.

They can create their digital identity themselves and distribute their public

key to the distributed network. This provides distributed decentralized

anonymous identity management to the users. However, in the distributed

blockchain all the nodes have copies of all the transactions as described in

section 3.1.4. This means a node can see all the history of all transactions.

Thus, a node can observe the history of the user transaction and might be

able to link or guess the real world identity. Therefore, blockchain provides

pseudoanonymity rather than real anonymity.

3.2.4 Merkle Tree

Blockchain uses P2P network where each peer must have same copy of

data and new data must be propagated and verified across the network [62].

Propagating and verifying data over P2P network is time consuming and

computationally expensive. Therefore, Merkle tree is used which instead of

sending data only the hash of the data is sent and the receiver peer checks

the hash against the root of the Merkle tree which allows secure and efficient

verification of larger data structures as well as ensures data integrity. Merkle

tree or hash tree is binary tree of hash pointers 3.2.2 which ensures all the

peers/nodes must have same undamaged, unaltered, legitimate data and if a

data is changed in one node, changes must be propagated to every node.

Merkle tree is composed of a large number of blocks containing data or

transactions as shown in the Figure 5 [32]. These blocks form the leaves of

the Merkle tree and the transaction blocks are grouped into pairs of two

where each pair has hash pointers respectively which eventually, make the

next level up of the tree. Moreover, this process is repeated until the single

block is reached as shown in the Figure 5 and the single block is called root
