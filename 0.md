There has been considerable interest in the scalability and
performance characteristics of public blockchain networks and
specifically the limiting factor of the consensus protocol and
its security implications [31], [23].
Also for public blockchains, [19] have looked at quantifying
throughput, latency, bootstrap time and cost per transaction for
the Bitcoin network based on publicly available data.
BlockBench [22] was one of the first to look at permissioned

blockchain. They present a framework for comparing perfor-
mance of different blockchain platforms, namely, Ethereum,

Parity and Hyperledger Fabric using a set of micro and macro
benchmarks. Similar to [19] they generalize consensus, data,
execution and application as 4 layers of blockchain and use
the benchmarks to exercise them. They measure the overall
performance in terms of throughput, latency and scalability of
the platforms and draw conclusions across the 3 platforms.
However, they studied the performance of Fabric v0.6, with

v1.0 version bringing in a complete re-design, their observa-
tions do not hold relevance and needs re-study.

[16] presents the design and the new architecture of Fabric,
delving in-depth into its design considerations and modularity.
It presents the performance of a single Bitcoin like crypto
currency application on Fabric, called Fabcoin, which uses a
customized VSCC to validate the Fabcoin specific transactions
and avoid complex endorsements and channels. Further, they
used CLI command to emulate clients, which is not realistic,

instead of using a SDK [6], [8], [10]. Our work differs from
theirs in that, we do a comprehensive study for different
workloads keeping Fabric’s modularity and application in
multiple domains in focus.
A note to the reader, [16] used Fabric v1.1-preview release,
which incorporates all our optimizations and other additional
functionalities over v1.0. However, being a minor version
update much of the core functionality remains the same and
our observations hold true for v1.1 and future versions based
on the new architecture of Fabric.
VIII. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive empirical
study to understand the performance of Hyperledger Fabric,

a permissioned blockchain platform, by varying values as-
signed to configurable parameters such as block size, endorse-
ment policy, channels, resource allocation, and state database choices. As a result of our study, we provided six valuable
guidelines on configuring these parameters and also identified
three major performance bottlenecks. Hence, we introduced
and studied three simple optimizations such as MSP cache,
parallel VSCC validation, and bulk read/write during MVCC
validation & commit phase to improve the singe channel
performance by 16×. Further, these three optimizations have
been successfully adopted in Fabric v1.1
As a part of future work, we will study the scalability and
fault tolerant capability of Fabric by using different blockchain
topologies such as different number of organizations and
different number of nodes per organization. Further, we plan
to quantify the impact of various consensus algorithms and
number of nodes in the ordering service on the performance of
different workloads. In our study, we assumed that the network
is not a bottleneck. However, in the real world setup, nodes
can be geographically distributed and hence, the network
might play a role. In addition, the arrival rates in real world
production system would be following certain distributions.
Hence, we will study the performance of Fabric in Wide Area
Network (WAN) with different arrival rate distributions.

We wish to acknowledge our following colleagues for their
valuable assistance to our work. Our proposed optimizations

were successfully adopted to Fabric, thanks to fabric devel-
opers who took care of submitting patches to Fabric v1.1.
