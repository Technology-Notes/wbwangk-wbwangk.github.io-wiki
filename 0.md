Due to the CPU contention, the VSCC latency also in-
creased that affected the commit latency as shown in Figure

9(c). Increasing the vCPUs allocation increased CPU utiliza-
tion and consequently performance up-to a peak where vCPUs
matched the number of channels. Beyond this, additionally al-
located vCPUs were idle due to the single-threaded sequential

VSCC validation – refer to Figure 9(c).
Figure 9(d) plot the throughput and latency for 16 channels
in a heterogeneous setup. Table VI presents a various number
of vCPUs allocated for different peers to enable heterogeneity,
the number of channels, transaction complexity and transaction
arrival rate used. For other parameters, refer to Table I.
Observation 9: At moderate loads, even when the number
of vCPUs allocated for 2 peers out of 8 were lesser than the
channel count, performance degraded. For e.g., when only 2
vCPUs were allocated for 2 peers (others with 32 vCPUs),
the throughput reduced from 848 tps to 417 tps (by 2×) for

write-only transactions and to 307 tps (by 2.7×) for read-
write transactions. The reasons for the reduction are twofold,

endorsement requests timeout from less powerful peers and
MVCC conflicts specifically for read/write transactions. Figure

10(a) plots the endorsement requests timeout, valid transac-
tions and invalid transactions due to MVCC conflicts for read-
write transactions. With an increase in the number of less

powerful peers, the endorsement requests timeout increased.
Further, a higher proportion of total submitted transactions
became invalid due to MVCC conflicts. The is because of the
lower block commit rate at less powerful peers as compared
to powerful peers. Due to the different block height at peers
(refer to Figure 10(b)), there was a mismatch of key’s version
in the read-set collected. As a result, MVCC conflicts occurred
during the state validation which invalidated transactions.

Though we have not studied the impact of network re-
sources, we believe that the impact would be similar to that of

CPU. This is because, with a low network bandwidth, the delay
in both the block and transaction delivery would increase. Even
with the heterogeneous network resources for peers, we expect
the impact to be similar to the one we observed with CPU.

Guideline 4: To achieve higher throughput and lower la-
tency, it is better to allocate at least one vCPU per channel. For

optimal vCPU allocation, we need to determine the expected
load at each channel and allocate adequate vCPUs accordingly.
Guideline 5: To achieve higher throughput and lower
latency, it is better to avoid heterogeneous peers as the
performance would be dictated by less powerful peers.
Action Item 3: Processing transactions within a channel and
across channels can be improved to better utilize additional
CPU power as shown in §VI-B.
